Requirements: 

1. Only when you click on submit the metamask plugin should open, right?
2. When clicking on "confirm and submit", the transaction on metamask doesn't do "confirm". I think this is required to establish minimum interaction with metamask plugin.
3. If we click on the submit button, irrespective of whether we do "no", "confirm or submit", or click outside, it leads to creation of batch of pending transactions. A user can confirm any of them which is bad. 
4. After we submit a form for confirmation, we should put a delay of 5 seconds reload, and then refresh the page to show the records screen

5. Need main headline for employee page like in the employer page
6. Make form similar to employer page
